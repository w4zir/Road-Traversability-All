# Road-Traversability

Find the traversability of road for specific vehicle using vehicle model. Standard PRM is generated using vehicle and terrain model and graph theoretic analysis are performed to compute RTI (Road Traversability Index) which outputs a value between 0 and 1 that represent the ralative traversability of the vehicle on the road.
